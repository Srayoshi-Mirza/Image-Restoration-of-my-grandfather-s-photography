# Image Restoration of my grandfather's photography

Introduction
My Grandfather was a photographer and used to take photos of the war that happened in 1971. He also owned a Photo development studio. I never met him but these to images we found many years after his death. The Images have destroyed some intent. My mother wanted to restore these images to commemorate her late Father's Work. And mainly I thought about using Deep Learning on these images to restore them as close to the original as possible.

As an image enhancement, the principle goal of restoration techniques is to improve an image in some predefined sense. Restoration attempts to recover an image that has been degraded by using prior knowledge of the degradation phenomenon. Thus, restoration techniques are oriented towards modeling the degradation and applying the inverse process to recover the original image.[1] 
The purpose of image restoration is to "compensate for" or "undo" defects that degrade an image. Degradation comes in many forms, such as motion blur, noise, and camera misfocus. In cases like motion blur, it is possible to come up with a very good estimate of the actual blurring function and "undo" the blur to restore the original image. In cases where the image is corrupted by noise, the best we can hope to do is compensate for the degradation it caused. In this project, we will introduce and implement several of the methods used in the image processing world to restore images.[3]
